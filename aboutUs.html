		<h1 style="text-align:center;"> About Us </h1>
		
			<p>
					We are a high school robotics club/ team based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Our members are students who attend Sir Winston Churchill High School. Team 4719 gives these students the opportunity to learn and take interest in technology, science, math and engineering in a fun and stimulating way under the guidance of professional mentors and teachers. </p>

				<h1 style="text-align:center;" >2014 – Aerial Assist </h1>
				<p>
				In 2014, we competed in the FRC Western Canada Regional; this time with our robot "Jerry" (named after our countless makeshift repairs and jerry-rigging we performed on it). This year we placed first alongside our alliance members 4334 and 2013, which allowed us to qualify us for the world championship in St. Louis. There, we ranked 35th in the Galileo division. Many of the skills we gained from our first robot and other teams' bots did not go to waste. Participating in St. Louis was definitely unforgettable opportunity for students and mentors alike. Competing amongst the best of the best was an amazing honor for us all and an experience of a lifetime. It was an exceptional year for 4719 and we can’t wait to see what the future has in store for us.</p>

					<h1 style="text-align:center;" >2013 – Ultimate Ascent</h1> 
					<p>
						In 2013 we competed in the FRC Western Canada Regional with our Frisbee bot, and made it to the final qualifying rounds, ranking 23rd overall. As it was our rookie year, our members and mentors had never experienced the atmosphere of a FIRST competition. However, that didn’t stop us from taking up the challenge! We developed many important STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) skills like designing, prototyping, constructing, programming and driving a FRC robot. Along the way, we also picked up skills in team building, leadership, and gracious professionalism. Not only did we build an awesome robot, but an awesome community as well.</p>
