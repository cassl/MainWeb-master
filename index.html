	<h1> The Team </h1>
			<p>
We are a high school robotics club and team based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Our members are students who attend Sir Winston Churchill High School. Team 4719 gives these students the opportunity to learn and take interest in technology, science, math and engineering in a fun and stimulating way under the guidance of professional mentors and teachers. </p>

	<h1> FRC </h1>
		<p>The FIRST Robotics Competition, also known as FRC, is an annual and international robotics competition for grades 9-12 (ages 14-18). It blends the excitement and competitive nature of sport with the ingenuity and innovations of science and technology. Given time constraints and strict rules to follow, teams of high school students and their professional volunteer mentors must build and program robots that perform that year's task against other teams. This allows young adults to take interest in science, mathematics, engineering and technology in a fun and exciting way.

		<h1>VEX</h1>
		<p>
		The VEX Robotics Competition is an annual robotics competition in which middle school, high school and college/university level students can participate in. It utilizes the VEX Robotics Design System and offers all the excitement and challenge of a FIRST Robotics Competition, but at a more affordable cost. It has quickly become one of the world's largest and fastest-growing robotics competition for middle and high school students.

		<h1> VEX Robotics </h1>
		<p>
		The VEX Robotics Design System is a robotics kit designed to introduce students to the world of robotics. It offers them a platform where they can learn and get excited about science, technology, engineering and math. Using VEX technology, students can build and program their very own robots for the classroom and competitions alike.
